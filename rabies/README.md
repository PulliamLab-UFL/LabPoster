# Research Questions
> 1-2 primary research questions

# Approaches and tools
> a brief description of approaches/tools

- R and R studio
- GitHub
- Differential equation models (and stochastic analogues such as the Gillespie algorithm)
- Partially observed Markov process models
- Maximum likelihood and model selection via information criteria
- Analysis of time series data

# Findings
>  1-2 key take-home points/findings

# Graphics
> a nice graphic (potentially 2 for more developed projects with results)

#### Potential graphics
- model diagram
- some version of seasonality plots for the 3 species
- plots showing patterns in both positive and negative submissions
- diagram of the modeling process (with process and observation models)
- observation process diagram or table
