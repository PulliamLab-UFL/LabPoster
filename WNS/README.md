# Research Questions
> 1-2 primary research questions

- What factors determine susceptibility to *Pseudogymnoascus destructans*, the fungus that causes White Nose Syndrome in bats?

# Approaches and tools
> a brief description of approaches/tools

- R and R studio
- Physiological modeling

# Findings
>  1-2 key take-home points/findings

- Environmental conditions (temperature and humidity) affect over-winter bat mortality both direcly and indirecty via their  fungal growth .
- Host traits, such as body size, lowest hibernation temperatures, and bat metabolic rates that scale with these traits, could be used to predict survival in species and locations that are not currently affected.
