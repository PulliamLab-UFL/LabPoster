# Research Goals

- Develop a viral-challenge study that will elucidate the underlying mechanisms that influence cross-species transmission of viruses in vertebrate hosts.
- Test the hypothesis that these mechanisms interact with conditions imposed on domesticated species by humans. 

# Approaches and tools

- Reciprocal transplant experimental design
- Collect transmission and disease data from a RNA virus infection in and between two fish species 
- Examin how density influences transmission  
- q-PCR and virus isolation 
- R and R studio
- GitHub
- Analysis of data
