# Research Questions
> 1-2 primary research questions
- How do local social, political and economic contexts of life in rural Yucatec Mayan villages influence the transmission and control of Chagas?
- What can be done to optimize the desired outcomes (knowledge, attitudes and practices) and reduce barriers in preparation for scale-up?

# Approaches and tools
> a brief description of approaches/tools

- Household surveys
- Participant observation
- Community-based participatory research

# Findings
>  1-2 key take-home points/findings
- Chagas educational initiatives should be integrated into the Oportunidades social welfare program's annual community talks about dengue to create a "vector-borne disease" topic
- Further training among community members and medical personnel on the identification of the signs and symptoms of Chagas is needed to promote health-seeking behavior
- Insect screens are viable options for sustained control of house infestation, however, household economics prohibit their purchase. Distribution needs to be sponsored by local, regional or national governments or NGOs to achieve 100% coverage.
