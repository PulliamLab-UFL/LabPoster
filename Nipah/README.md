# Research Questions
> 1-2 primary research questions

- What demographic and behavioral factors are associated with increased or decreased risk of human-to-human transmission Nipah virus in Bangladesh?
- To what extent could virological changes or introduction in areas with different social structures permit epidemic invasion of the virus?

# Approaches and tools
> a brief description of approaches/tools

- R and R studio
- Maximum likelihood and model selection via information criteria
- Network-based anlysis of case-contact data to identify risk factors for transmission

# Findings
>  1-2 key take-home points/findings

- Preliminary findings indicate that the probability of transmission, given contact between a susceptible individual and a person infected with Nipah virus, varies by outbreak, but we do not yet know what drives this variation.

# Graphics
> a nice graphic (potentially 2 for more developed projects with results)

#### Potential graphics
- Faridpur case network
- Transmission probability estimate plot/s
