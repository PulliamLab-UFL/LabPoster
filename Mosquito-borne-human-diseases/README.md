# Research Questions
- What factors that drive specific regional differences in dengue dynamics?
- What is the best use of interventions like vaccine and vector control that are only partially effective?

# Approaches and tools
- Integration of diverse data sources including satellite imagery, censuses, reported case and serosurvey records
- Individual (human and mosquito) stochastic simulation
- C++/R/Python/JavaScript

# Findings
>  1-2 key take-home points/findings

# Graphics
> a nice graphic (potentially 2 for more developed projects with results)

#### Potential graphics
- model diagram
- some version of seasonality plots for the 3 species
- plots showing patterns in both positive and negative submissions
- diagram of the modeling process (with process and observation models)
- observation process diagram or table
