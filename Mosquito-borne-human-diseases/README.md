# Research Questions
- What factors drive specific regional differences in dengue dynamics?
- What is the best use of partially-effective interventions like vaccines and vector control measures?

# Approaches and tools
- Integration of diverse data sources including satellite imagery, censuses, reported case and serosurvey records
- Individual (human and mosquito) stochastic simulation
- C++/R/Python/JavaScript

# Findings
- Local immune profile can vary substantially over time and space
- Frequency of introductions likely determines predictability of epidemics

# Graphics
- House-workplace-school cartoon
- Immune profile
